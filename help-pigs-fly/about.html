                    <p class="intro__para">For years now, pigs have been forced to roll in the mud, sullying themselves until their last day on the earth (literally),
                        when their carcasses are stripped bare for human consumption. We wanted to change the plight of pigs all over the world. We
                        wanted to free pigs from their oppression.</p>
                    <p class="intro__para">After carefully considering our options, we came to the conclusion that the only
                        way to provide pigs with both freedom and escape from human exploits is to give pigs wings. Thus, we came up with "Pwings" - pig wings
                        that provide flight and consequent freedom. (Adage about impossible)</p>
